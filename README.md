# Go Basics Practice

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark, and this is where I mess around with the basics Go.
I'm learning the language, so don't expect anything too fancy here.

Just so you know - this is all just for practice. Feel free to poke around, though! Who knows, you might find something cool. ðŸš€

## What's Inside?

### Public Holidays CLI

I made this little command-line thing that shows public holidays for different countries. Want to try it? Just clone the repo, navigate to the `public-holidays` directory, and run it.
